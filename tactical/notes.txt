* Make data points clickable on all graphs
  Data points can respond to events: http://api.highcharts.com/highcharts/series%3Cbar%3E.point.events
  There's a fiddle sample there.
  They get passed a Point object in the this pointer:  http://api.highcharts.com/highcharts/Point
  So, now I need to set a data key on each point for the URL to use...
  Basically, in the chart under pltoOptions, after column, add:
            series: {
                cursor: 'pointer',
                point: {
                    events: {
                        click: function () {
                            Navigate to this link...
                             location.href = 'https://cradlepoint.atlassian.net/search?jql=' + this.options.key;
                                this.options.key;
                        }
                    }
            }
